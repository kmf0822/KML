If you're creating your own file, the code in this example assumes:

Your file is hosted publicly on the internet. This is a requirement for all applications loading KML into a KMLLayer. Google's servers need to be able to find and retrieve the content in order to display it on the map - this also means that the file can't be on a password-protected page.
